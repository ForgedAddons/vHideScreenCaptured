WoW Addon: vHideScreenCaptured
========================

Hides "Screen Captured" information. Just. With near-zero memory footprint.

Why?
Because "Hide Screen Captured" by Rawesome loads some additional changes not connected to base functionality:
- New slash commands
- Button for selling grays
- A build-in calculator

And some people would prefer just the basic stuff.
